<!-- In AngularJS you can make your own service, or use one of the many built-in services.
What is a Service? A service is a function, or object, that is available for,
and limited to, your AngularJS application. AngularJS has about 30 built-in services.
One of them is the $location service. The $location service has methods which return
information about the location of the current web page. Note that the $location service
is passed in to the controller as an argument. In order to use the service in the controller,
it must be defined as a dependency. -->

<!-- For many services, like the $location service, it seems like you could use objects
that are already in the DOM, like the window.location object, and you could, but it
would have some limitations, at least for your AngularJS application. AngularJS constantly
supervises your application, and for it to handle changes and events properly,
AngularJS prefers that you use the $location service instead of the window.location object. -->


  <body>
    <p>This example uses the built-in $location service to get the absolute url of the page.</p>
    <div ng-app="myApp" ng-controller="myCtrl">
      <p>The url of this page is:</p>
      <h3>{{myUrl}}</h3>
    </div>
    <script>
      var app = angular.module('myApp', []);
      app.controller('myCtrl', function($scope, $location) {
          $scope.myUrl = $location.absUrl();
      });
    </script>

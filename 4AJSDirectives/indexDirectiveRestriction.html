<!-- You can restrict your directives to only be invoked by some of the methods.
By adding a restrict property with the value "A", the directive can only be invoked by attributes.
The legal restrict values are:
  - E for Element name
  - A for Attribute
  - C for Class
  - M for Comment
By default the value is EA, meaning that both Element names and attribute names can invoke the directive. -->


<body ng-app="myApp">

<p>Element:</p>
<new-directive></new-directive>

<p>Attribute:</p>
<div new-directive></div>

<p>Class:</p>
<div class="new-directive"></div>

<p>Comment:</p>
<!-- directive: new-directive -->

<script>
var app = angular.module("myApp", []);
app.directive("newDirective", function() {
    return {
        restrict : "A",
        template : "<h1>Made by a directive!</h1>"
    };
});
</script>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> By setting the <strong>restrict</strong>
  property to "A", only the HTML element with the "new-directive"
  attribute has invoked the directive.</p>

THE NG-APP DIRECTIVE
The ng-app directive defines the root element of an AngularJS application.
The ng-app directive will auto-bootstrap (automatically initialize) the application when a web page is loaded.

THE NG-INIT DIRECTIVE
The ng-init directive defines initial values for an AngularJS application.
Normally, you will not use ng-init. You will use a controller or module instead.

THE NG-MODEL DIRECTIVE
The ng-model directive binds the value of HTML controls (input, select, textarea) to application data.
The ng-model directive can also:
  - Provide type validation for application data (number, email, required).
  - Provide status for application data (invalid, dirty, touched, error).
  - Provide CSS classes for HTML elements.
  - Bind HTML elements to HTML forms.

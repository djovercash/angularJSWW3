<!-- Data binding in AngularJS is the synchronization between the model and the view.
AngularJS applications usually have a data model. The data model is a collection
of data available for the application (line 27 through line 30).

The HTML container where the AngularJS application is displayed, is called the view.
The view has access to the model, and there are several ways of displaying model data in the view.
You can use the ng-bind directive, which will bind the innerHTML of the element to the specified model property.
You can also use double braces {{ }} to display content from the model.
Or you can use the ng-model directive (input, select, textarea) on HTML controls to bind the model to the view.
NOTE: The ng-model directive provides a two-way binding between the model and the view. -->


<body>

<div ng-app="myApp" ng-controller="myCtrl">
    <p ng-bind="firstname"></p>
    <p>First Name: {{firstname}}</p>
    <input ng-model="firstname">
</div>

<script>
var app = angular.module('myApp', []);
app.controller('myCtrl', function($scope) {
    $scope.firstname = "John";
    $scope.lastname = "Doe";
});
</script>

</body>
</html>

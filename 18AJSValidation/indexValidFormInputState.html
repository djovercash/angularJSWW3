<!-- AngularJS is constantly updating the state of both the form and the input fields.
Input fields have the following states (all properties of the input field, and are either true or false.):
  - $untouched: The field has not been touched yet
  - $touched: The field has been touched
  - $pristine: The field has not been modified yet
  - $dirty: The field has been modified
  - $invalid: The field content is not valid
  - $valid: The field content is valid

Forms have the following states (all properties of the form, and are either true or false):
  - $pristine: No fields have been modified yet
  - $dirty: One or more have been modified
  - $invalid: The form content is not valid
  - $valid: The form content is valid
  - $submitted: The form is submitted

You can use these states to show meaningful messages to the user.
Example, if a field is required, and the user leaves it blank, you should give the user a warning. -->


  <body ng-app="">
    <p>We use the ng-show directive to only show the error message if the field has been touched AND is empty.</p>
    <p>Try leaving the first input field blank:</p>
    <form name="myForm">
      <p>Name:
        <input name="myName" ng-model="myName" required>
        <span ng-show="myForm.myName.$touched && myForm.myName.$invalid">The name is required.</span>
      </p>

      <p>Address:
        <input name="myAddress" ng-model="myAddress" required>
      </p>
    </form>
  </body>
</html>

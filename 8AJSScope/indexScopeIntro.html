<!-- The scope is the binding part between the HTML (view) and the JavaScript (controller).
The scope is an object with the available properties and methods.
The scope is available for both the view and the controller.
When you make a controller in AngularJS, you pass the $scope object as an argument.
When adding properties to the $scope object in the controller, the view (HTML) gets access to these properties.
In the view, you do not use the prefix $scope, you just refer to a propertyname, like {{carname}}. -->


<body>

<div ng-app="myApp" ng-controller="myCtrl">

<h1>{{carname}}</h1>

</div>

<script>
var app = angular.module('myApp', []);
app.controller('myCtrl', function($scope) {
    $scope.carname = "Volvo";
});
</script>

<p>The property "carname" was made in the controller, and can be referred to in the view by using the {{ }} brackets.</p>

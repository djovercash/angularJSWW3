<!-- It is important to know which scope you are dealing with, at any time.
For larger applications there can be sections in the HTML DOM which can only access certain scopes.
When dealing with the ng-repeat directive, each repetition has access to the current repetition object (see below).
Each <li> element has access to the current repetition object, in this case a string, which is referred to by using x. -->


<body>

<div ng-app="myApp" ng-controller="myCtrl">

<ul>
    <li ng-repeat="x in names" id="{{$index}}">{{x}}</li>
</ul>

</div>

<script>
var app = angular.module('myApp', []);

app.controller('myCtrl', function($scope) {
    $scope.names = ["James", "Sheila", "Darren", "Bianca"];
});
</script>

<p>The variable "x" has a different value for each repetition, proving that each repetition has its own scope.</p>

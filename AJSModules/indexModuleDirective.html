In addition you can use the module to add your own directives to your applications -->

<div ng-app="myApp" w3-test-directive></div>

<script>
var app = angular.module("myApp", []);
app.directive("w3TestDirective", function() {
    return {
        template : "I was made in a directive constructor!"
